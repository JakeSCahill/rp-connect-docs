= Serverless


Currently the only supported serverless deployment of {page-component-title} is for
xref:guides:serverless/lambda.adoc[AWS Lambda], if you are interested in other platforms please
https://github.com/{project-github}/issues[raise an issue^].

[NOTE]
.Looking for something less manual?
====
Rather than bundle the distribution and configs yourself,
check out https://github.com/makenew/serverless-benthos[makenew/serverless-benthos^], which makes quick work of deploying
a {page-component-title} serverless project on AWS Lambda.
For building and deploying distributions with custom plugins,
look at https://github.com/makenew/benthos-plugin[makenew/benthos-plugin^].
