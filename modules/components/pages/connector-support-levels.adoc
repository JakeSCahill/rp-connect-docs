= Connector Support Levels
:description: Learn about the support levels that are available for different connectors and connector types.

Each connector has a corresponding level of support, which determines whether it is suitable for production environments or community-driven projects.

- *Certified*: Production-ready and available to purchase with Redpanda support.
- *Community*: Not considered production-ready and available only for community support in https://redpanda.com/slack[Slack^].

Anyone can use the certified and community connectors. However, Enterprise connectors require an https://redpanda.com/compare-platform-editions[Enterprise Edition license^].
